## Developer Notes

- This project reinforced the importance of organized user stories, which were vital for keeping me sane while constructing CRUD functionality.
- It was satisfying to add in slightly more interactive features compared to project one, like hover transformations, user/collection preview images, and confirmation overlays. 
- I did feel less structured in my attempt at styling, with user stories becoming less defined at that point. This might be fixed by having a more specific visual design in mind at the start, although the flexibility was also beneficial. 
- The question of setting up a user and their collections all from one page seems like a difficult and interesting challenge to tackle given way more time.
- It also would have been awesome to include optional video/link properties for items, so things
